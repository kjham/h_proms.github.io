&lt;p&gt;이번 포스팅에서는 Multi-Thread 를 사용하기 좋은 ExecutorService 를 소개하겠습니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExecutorService 는 Thread와 비교하여 다음과 같은 장점이 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;여러 Thread 에 대한 결과 값을 개별적으로 받을 수 있습니다.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;이상입니다. 이번 포스팅을 마치도록 하겠습니다.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Keon-Joo, Ham</name></author><category term="sw-dev-lab" /><summary type="html">Java - Thread Tutorial (2) : ExecutorService</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">(Java) Logging Introduction (1)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/java-log4j" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="(Java) Logging Introduction (1)" /><published>2018-02-19T09:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2018-02-19T09:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/java-log4j</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/java-log4j">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Java - Logging Introduction (1) : 종류&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application Project 를 진행하면 필수 요소 중 하나가 Log 를 남기는 Framework 구성입니다.
제품 개발이나 운영 시, 발생하는 문제를 추적하여 원인을 파악하기 위함이죠.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;굉장히 유용한 Framework 이기 때문에 종류 또한 꽤 다양합니다.
또한, Logging 작업이 굉장히 많은 Project 를 위해 관리해주는 또 다른 Framework 가 있기도 하죠.
심지어 비용을 지불하고 구매할 정도로 막강한 기능을 갖고 있죠.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;우선, 종류에 대해 간단히 살펴보고 자세히 알아보도록 하겠습니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Java Util Logging (JUL)
제가 직접 Performance Test 를 한 것은 아니지만, Log4J 와 Logback 에 비해 평가가 그리 좋지 못합니다.
평가의 척도는 속도나 기능적인 면이지요.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Log4J 1.x
지금까지 가장 많이 사용된 Logging Framwork 일겁니다. 그러나, Log4J2 와 Logback 의 등장으로 사용 빈도가 점차 줄어들고 있지 않나 생각됩니다.
공식적으로 Log4J 1.x 는 유지보수/개발이 끝났기 때문이죠.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Log4J 2.x
Log4J 후속작이며, 많이 활성화 되고 있는 Logging Framework 입니다.
나중에 다루게 된다면, Log4J 2.x 와 Logback 비교가 꽤 유용한 공부가 될 것 같습니다.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Logback
마찬가지로 Log4J의 후속작입니다.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://beyondj2ee.wordpress.com/2012/11/09/logback-%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%B4%EC%95%BC-%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EC%9D%B4%EC%9C%A0-reasons-to-prefer-logback-over-log4j/&quot; alt=&quot;참고 주소&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JBossAS란?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JBossAS(JBoss Application Server)란 오픈소스 Java EE 서버입니다. Java EE 서버란 Java Enterprise Edition(EE) 표준에 따라 구현된 서버를 의미합니다. Java EE 서버를 흔희 Java EE 서버를 WAS(Web Application Server)라고 부르는데 이러한 서버는 BEA WebLogic, Tmax JEUS, IBM WebSphere, Adobe JRUN, JBoss, Apache Geronimo 등이 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Tomcat과 JBossAS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Tomcat은 Java EE 표준에 포함되어 있는 JSP, Servlet, JSTL 등과 같은 웹 애플리케이션 개발을 위한 표준을 구현한 웹 컨테이너입니다. Java EE 표준에는 다양한 컨테이너가 정의되어 있는데 대표적인 컨테이너가 웹 컨테이너와 EJB 컨테이너입니다. 웹 애플리케이션을 개발하기 위해서 필요한 웹 컨테이너를 구현한 것이 바로 Apache Tomcat이며, JBossAS는 Java EE 표준에 포함되어 있는 모든 표준을 구현한 완전한 Java EE 서버라고 할 수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;예를 들면 EJB나 JMS를 사용한 애플리케이션을 개발하고자 하는 경우에는 반드시 JBossAS와 같은 Java EE 표준을 모두 구현한 서버를 사용해야 겠습니다. 그러나 단순한 웹 애플리케이션을 구현하는 경우에는 Apache Tomcat을 사용할 수 있습니다. JBossAS에는 기본적으로 Tomcat이 내장되어 있으므로 Tomcat을 사용했었던 사용자는 손쉽게 JBossAS로 웹 애플리케이션을 이전할 수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Java&lt;/strong&gt;에서 여러 작업을 동시에 처리하고 싶은 경우나 비동기 적으로 작업을 수행하고자 할 때, Thread 라는 것을 사용합니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;일반적으로 가장 많이 알려진 것은, Thread / Runnable 방식이 있습니다.
Thread 는 Class로 정의되어 있고, 실제 기능 동작을 위한 추상 메소드를 포함하고 있습니다.
따라서, Thread 만 사용하게 되는 경우 사용자 정의 클래스에 상속 받아서 사용해야 하지요.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// CustomThread 선언&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomThread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;customThread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;그러나 불필요한 Thread 상속을 하고싶지 않을 수 있습니다.
이 때 사용되는 것이 Interface 로 구현된 Runnable 입니다.
Runnable 을 선언하고, 실제 기능 동작할 메소드를 추상메소드에 넣고 Thread에 전달하기만 하면 됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thread 는 비동기적으로 데이터를 처리합니다.
비동기적이라는 것은 &lt;strong&gt;thread.start()&lt;/strong&gt; 에서 결과를 반환해주기 전까지 기다리지 않고, 바로 다음 코드를 진행한다는 겁니다.
따라서, 작업이 완료되는 것을 기다리기 위해 &lt;strong&gt;thread.join()&lt;/strong&gt; 을 위 코드에서 사용하였습니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;지금까지 Single-Thread 를 다루었습니다.
Thread Class 를 이용하여 Multi-Thread 방식을 취하려면, 여러 개의 Thread를 생성해야 합니다.
즉, List, Vector 등 자료구조로 Thread 에 대한 배열을 생성해야 하는 것이지요.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-Thread 는 Java 의 ExecutorService 를 통해 소개하도록 하겠습니다.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That’s who it works best for. If you’re using Ghost for some other purpose, that’s fine too - but it might not be the best choice for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The entire platform can be modified and customized to suit your needs, which is very powerful, but doing so &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/pricing&quot;&gt;Ghost(Pro)&lt;/a&gt; service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern journalism.&lt;/p&gt;

Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How long did it take you to catch them?” the American asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Only a little while,” the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” the American then asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,” the Mexican said as he unloaded them into a basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But… What do you do with the rest of your time?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mexican looked up and smiled. “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Julia, and stroll into the village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, señor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American laughed and stood tall. “Sir, I’m a Harvard M.B.A. and can help you. You should spend more time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with the increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He continued, “Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course, and move to Mexico City, then to Los Angeles, and eventually to New York City, where you could run your expanded enterprise with proper management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, señor, how long will all this take?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which the American replied, “15-20 years, 25 tops.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But what then, señor?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Millions señor? Then what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll in to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the “unalienable Rights” of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we’ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot walk alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot turn back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: “For Whites Only.” We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest – quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;strong&gt;dream&lt;/strong&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of “interposition” and “nullification” – one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;strong&gt;dream&lt;/strong&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this will be the day – this will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My country ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim’s pride,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From every mountainside, let freedom ring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not only that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From every mountainside, let freedom ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free at last! Free at last!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>martin</name></author><category term="test-page" /><summary type="html">I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.</summary></entry></feed>
